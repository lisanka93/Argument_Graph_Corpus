Depth4_1,Depth3_11,"So if someone wants to pursue a career where a degree is necessary, he or she should be willing to invest into their future by taking a loan. Jobs that require a degree offer a decent salary that should make the repayment of the loan not too high of burden.",loan,job,career,
Depth4_3,Depth3_11,"You are right, it depends on the industry. However, too many people with degrees go into jobs that would benefit from more practical and less academic knowledge. Instead of lowering university fees, I think the UK should invest in schemes and people to gain practical knowledge.",job,,,
Depth4_7,Depth3_11,"That's true but if a degree is completely needed and a person don't have the money to get one, they can get a scholarship",scholarship,,,
Depth4_15,Depth3_12,The money would be raised by taxes and not everybody that is a tax payer has been to university so it is not fair to make tax payers pay for university fees.,tax,,,
Depth4_16,Depth3_12,"I lived in Germany and Austria. Both countries offer free university education. If you add up the taxes and social security contributions, the cost to the individual is significantly higher than in the UK.",free,tax,,
Depth4_19,Depth3_12,"Sure, but free for the best only, and the career path does not necessarily begins with a degree but you can be successful by learning a profession. Also there is a strong connection with the industries who will co-finance the degree of their future employees. ",free,career,,
Depth4_27,Depth3_13,this is an investment into the future that the student was willing to take. Not everything in life is for free,free,,,
Depth4_29,Depth3_13,"You are right, the interest rates are increasing to a level I feel uncomfortable with. Instead of lowering the university fees, maybe the government could invest so that the interest rates stay low or even 0%.",interest,government,,
Depth4_32,Depth3_13,"Being a loan it's normal they will pay the interest. The loan is an opportunity not an obligation. The brightest will manage to get a tuition fee waiver or even a scholarship. This also helps selection, and make sure the brightest will have the best chance to get a degree.",loan,scholarship,interest,
Depth4_35,Depth3_13,"The importance here, though, is that the banks take care of the incapability of some students that can't afford university fees. They overcome this problem through a loan, which with a good program of their economics can solve in few years.",loan,afford,,

Depth4_62,Depth3_15,"Exactly, people hope to get a high paying job with a university degree, thus it is an investment. If that investment is successful they have the financial means to repay the loan, and if not, they won't have to pay the loan back themselves.",loan,job,,
Depth4_66,Depth3_16,"If someone studies a degree which is in ""demand"" they should have no problem of finding a job and repaying the loan afterwards. If someone wants to study art history, it is their own risk and they should have to pay/take a loan",loan,job,,
Depth4_77,Depth3_16,Without having to pay the loan back unless you meet a certain threshold and the loan defaulting after a certain time period it is unlikely that even financially stricken students will struggle post degree. ,loan,,,
Depth4_78,Depth3_16,University is not a right. Most people fall into university because they think they have too. Going to university should be an important decision and taking a loan should be part of this. ,loan,,,

Depth4_96,Depth3_22,Sure but then why not to take a loan and pay back individually instead of putting this burden to the shoulders of the entire society? If taxes are higher people want them to be used for improving the healthcare system or infrastructure.,loan,tax,,
Depth4_102,Depth3_23,"It's true that should be a human right, and I don't agree that they need to get lifelong debt in order to study. The government should offer them scholarships.

Depth4_132,Depth3_26,That's why the government should start giving scholarships to people who really can't pay university fees but still want to get a degree.,scholarship,government,,
Depth4_134,Depth3_26,"if we agree to stop student loans and get everyone educated this burdens every other citizen through taxes
the difference is that the student makes a choice on the loan but the citizen does not",loan,tax,,
Depth4_136,Depth3_26,"As for the person it's a decision with consequences for a better career. As for the economy, loans are usually good for the economy and it also motivates the student to get a high paid job to pay back the loan as soon as possible.",loan,job,career,
Depth4_138,Depth3_26,"It gives them an objective to accomplish, it gives value to their degree and future career, getting free education is good and necessary in some cases but that also gives people the option to slack off and reduce their chances of getting a proper work ethic.",free,career,,

Depth4_161,Depth3_33,But that's another concern. The government has to stay alert and check if the loans are well levered.,loan,government,,
Depth4_162,Depth3_33,"Students may be careless with their money but that is how most young people learn how to manage their money, either in at uni or in their first jobs. The way the loan is paid back is an additional tax for something you chose to do",loan,job,tax,
Depth4_172,Depth3_34,"Greater awareness should be given to all students on what having these loans means, that it is a different type of debt that doesn't count against you.",loan,debt,,

Depth4_192,Depth3_36,They still can attend university now. If the fees were removed they still wouldn't go as they can't afford maintenance fees and instead would start working.,afford,,,
Depth4_196,Depth3_36,taxes are recovered from all in society which is what goes back to equally loft up the social needs based on who is in need of it,tax,,,
Depth4_197,Depth3_36,"Sure but not everyone is cut out to go to a university, there are a lot of existing jobs and not everyone is good at one thing. There is diversification and that is what makes this world go on.",job,,,
Depth4_201,Depth3_41,If everyone has equal opportunity to go to university then the majority of people will go. If there are fees in place then this will limit the number of people to those who feel a university degree would benefit their future career.,career,,,
Depth4_203,Depth3_41,"They all go to school and get equal knowledge and opportunities, it is got nothing to do with the family background. Whilst at high school, student get all the information they need to go further",background,,,

Depth4_215,Depth3_42,"These low paid jobs will be only for a while, until they pay off the loan. Also, people learn things and gain different experiences from everything. In this way, they will learn how to be patient and persistent and also dedicated to their actual dreams.",loan,job,,
Depth4_217,Depth3_42,"In my opinion, thanks to loans, the future master will actively seek work to pay off his debt",loan,debt,,
Depth4_220,Depth3_43,But the economy will always be balanced this way. The government helps the ones who can't pay (the government would have to ensure they can't pay or have really high difficulties in paying) and those who can pay will have more income anyway to place into the economy.,government,,,
Depth4_223,Depth3_43,University was never free and was always a high privilege to attend it so it should stay the same. There is an opportunity to take a loan and it is even better deal now as before the current scheme did not exist and ,loan,free,,
Depth4_226,Depth3_43,In the past it was much harder to get into a university and we didn't have so many universities. Paying back the debt also goes into the economy. ,debt,,,
Depth4_235,Depth3_44,"That's why there is a student loan, a government support for this difficulty which students will have to pay off afterwards, when they will have a job and are independent.",loan,job,government,
Depth4_236,Depth3_44,People should analyze their financial situation first before getting a loan. If they drop out they only paid 1 semester so the loan is even smaller. Other option is to find a part time job to get extra income.,loan,job,,
Depth4_238,Depth3_44,education loan gives plenty of time to student to repay the loan amount and students are allowed to work and study,loan,,,
Depth4_245,Depth3_45,"But there are a lot of jobs that they can apply for in order to pay off the student loan. But the degree is an extra qualification, which is a serious plus to his CV and he will have more opportunities.",loan,job,,
Depth4_251,Depth3_46,The loans provided from the government are designed to feature as a graduate tax. The government have to know they won't get the majority of the loans back. But a 'graduate tax' would be less popular with voters compared to 'student loans'.,loan,tax,government,

Depth4_268,Depth3_51,"If they never went they may talk their kids out of it too whether there is a loan or not. Most parents are supportive regardless of the loans, it is not the loan that makes them not see the point in university",loan,,,

Depth4_273,Depth3_52,"A student that is willing to take that loan, is really willing to study hard and appreciates the value of the degree, in contrary with the one that got there easily, without thinking the importance of studying.",loan,,,
Depth4_279,Depth3_53,The government should step out then and leave it to the banks to take the risk. Anyway with higher taxes and cheap education there would be plenty of educated unemployed to pay by the Government.,tax,government,,
Depth4_287,Depth3_53,"Higher taxes would negatively affect anyone who did not go to university unfairly, making society pay for students who refuse to pay back their loans.",loan,tax,,
Depth4_288,Depth3_53,"It is unfair to expect the whole of the country to pay for degrees without seeing the benefits, there are so many areas that need more funding that could cause the taxes to.increase that would offer more value than free university",free,tax,,
Depth4_290,Depth3_54,But if there are more people that go to the university it means they can afford it. ,afford,,,
Depth4_291,Depth3_54,"It is open and available for many, even for mature students. If you know want you want, taking loan will not stay on the way",loan,,,

Depth4_312,Depth3_56,The loans must depend on each person after completing the studies. And a person has to take the studies to develop in education to get a good job.,loan,job,,

Depth4_318,Depth3_56,It works for the people who get the jobs who can pay it back without negatively impacting those who do not get a well paid job. The less well paid people would be impacted more through an increase in all taxation than the current payback process.,job,,,

Depth4_1065,Depth3_183,Everyone won't have access to everything. It's right that there is a criteria in place to be able to provide education as in a lot of things in life but there will always be the exceptional cases where further consideration is required,access,,,
Depth4_1067,Depth3_183,Everyone should be able to access high quality education. By paying for fees we can have more resources to support everyone so that the field is level as everyone deserves equal opportunity ,access,,,

Depth4_1102,Depth3_191,I know what you're saying but the fees maintain that element of people going to University who actually want to be there. The fact it costs money motivates them. Without that you'd have people going to University for the wrong reasons because it's free. ,free,,,

Depth4_1122,Depth3_193,I couldn't disagree more. This is a loan which has been necessary for these students to better themselves. They shouldn't then be penalised by having this held against them in terms of a credit rating or by having to pay it back before they're able to do so. ,loan,,,
