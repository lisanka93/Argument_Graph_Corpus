Depth5_15,Depth4_27,"the student loan is a burden you have to carry throughout a lot of your professional and working life , which hinders your ability to live comfortably and puts pressure on individuals to find a good paying job",loan,job,,,

Depth5_39,Depth4_16,"that is a valid point . however , abolishing university fees does not have to mean higher taxes . we need to look for ways that universities can source money from other means rather than putting students into crippling debt .",debt,tax,,,

Depth5_43,Depth4_29,i do n't think a 0 % interest rate would be beneficial to the uk 's economy but by lowering the interest rates i reckon it might help to boost the uk economy .,interest,,,,
Depth5_44,Depth4_29,but is that even possible ? surely abolishing student fees would cut out the middle man and reduce the burden on every body . why reduce the interest when you could just scrap them altogether ?,interest,,,,
Depth5_51,Depth4_61,the fees are so high only doctors and solicitors can afford to pay fees back,afford,,,,
Depth5_53,Depth4_61,"without student loans , many students would not be able to attend university and therefore would not have the opportunity to work hard to get their degree . maybe we should have a more diverse stream of funding available to students .",loan,,,,

Depth5_87,Depth4_78,taking a loan is encouraging people to continue this behaviour during their working life . it 's just continuing to make bankers wealthier at the expense of others . fees should be abolished to open education up to all .,loan,,,,
Depth5_88,Depth4_78,they 're not that many job opportunities that pay a good wage that you do n't have to go to university to get . a degree is what employers are looking for to even get an interview .,job,,,,

Depth5_149,Depth4_142,introduce more work experience whilst undertaking a degree so that the graduate has some experience when applying for jobs,job,,,,
Depth5_151,Depth4_96,a loan can leave someone with a crippling amount of debt . in many cases the government ends up writing off student loans in any event . if students have more disposable income then they can reinvest that back into the economy .,loan,government,debt,,
Depth5_154,Depth4_96,"more people feeling able to study further creates better education across society , and paying by tax means the loans are n't placed upon the student all at once .",society,loan,tax,,

Depth5_156,Depth4_108,the goal that they should have in mind is completing their degree and then using that to find a good job .,job,,,,
Depth5_159,Depth4_108,saddling students who do not have the bank of mum and dad to rely on with huge debt does nothing but reduce the respect a degree deserves . it only helps the rich get richer .,debt,,,,

Depth5_164,Depth4_115,scholarships are few and far between . just because someone does n't come from a rich family does n't mean they deserve to be saddled with huge debts for the rest of their life .,family,scholarship,debt,,

Depth5_169,Depth4_126,"yet if someone is just below the 21,000 salary mark , they would be much less likely to go for a promotion or take on extra work if they have large student loans",loan,,,,
Depth5_174,Depth4_136,`` better '' careers are not necessarily high paid . teaching is a profession that i admire as one of the greatest careers yet it is not highly paid .,career,,,,

Depth5_183,Depth4_160,university education should be free and available to all instead of leaving children with crippling debt before they embark on their lives . we should be enabling instead of preventing further education and trusting our kids to be financially responsible should be on the timetable in all universities,free,debt,,,

Depth5_190,Depth4_172,universities are charging far too much for courses and should look to combine studies with online learning and more vocational input where the costs lie with and employer . they seem to be rising year on year and overall students leave with little work experience and a mountain of debt .,debt,,,,
Depth5_191,Depth4_172,i dont see how financial situations matter ? everyone has access to a student loan and people living in houses with lesser income are able to get further help in grant 's or additional student loans .,loan,access,,,
Depth5_192,Depth4_172,being that we are both from different backgrounds i can safely say that being on the poorer end does not in anyway encourage people to take out loans with high interest and get in debt for education,interest,loan,debt,background,

Depth5_212,Depth4_217,if the loan does n't require you to pay back unless youre a high earner theres no motivation,loan,,,,
Depth5_214,Depth4_217,student debt has almost doubled in this country and as a nation we are amongst the highest in the world . whilst a future master may seek to pay off debt there are a significant number of degrees that do not warrant the costs .,debt,,,,
Depth5_217,Depth4_161,"by abolishing the fees , we would save money and man poorer on the people ensuring these well levered loans . and by removing fees altogether , we a equipping a generation who may not be able to afford education otherwise , in a world where the majority of jobs require degree level education .",loan,afford,job,,

Depth5_223,Depth4_176,"but the government do n't assess this . the rich get richer and the poor get poorer , and are n't provided the opportunity to go into higher paid jobs . by abolishing fees it means that you get degrees and jobs based on intelligence and ability rather than the money in your bank .",government,job,,,
Depth5_224,Depth4_176,"no , the reality is that any amount of government involvement will not be able to reassure or convince the children of the poor to take out loans that represent years of income in the houses they were raised .",loan,government,,,
Depth5_227,Depth4_176,students want to learn not create lots of debt for themselves depending on their situation,debt,,,,
Depth5_229,Depth4_186,"but is n't it better to start your adult life on a blank canvas , rather than asking people to pay money back as their careers progress ? the implications of debt are massive and starting your life with such large ones seems almost neglectful to mental health .",career,debt,,,

Depth5_248,Depth4_220,but the major point here is that only some sectors of society will be comfortable with this redistribution of financial responsibility in education . only the rich and middle-classes are willing to undertake these huge debts that they know they will have help in paying off .,society,debt,,,

Depth5_259,Depth4_177,that still means that there is not equal opportunity . students from less well off backgrounds would have to work harder and longer than their more financially secure peers .,background,,,,
